No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

          <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.

You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h3 id="8">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
          <p><b>In Short:</b> <i>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i></p>
          <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">ec.europa.eu</a></p>
          <br><br>
          <h3 id="10">10. DATA BREACH</h3>
          <p>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when Snaplink believes you are likely to be at risk of serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Snaplink becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Snaplink will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h3 id="11">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h3 id="12">12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
          <p><b>In Short:</b> <i>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</i></p>
          <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
          <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h3 id="13">13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h3>
          <p><b>In Short:</b> <i>Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</i></p>
